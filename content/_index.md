## Overview

Pulse is a hackable dual-deploy altimeter for amateur rockets. It's compatible with the [Adafruit feather](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943) ecosystem and can fit expansion boards to add radio telemetry, GPS, or anything else that can fit in a [wing](https://www.adafruit.com/category/945).

This project is, for now, experimental. Only use these designs if you're willing to tinker and test thoroughly before use. Until the project has matured, don't use Pulse on serious or high-stakes flights.
